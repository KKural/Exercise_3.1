# Dodona Learning Path: Annotated Screenshots

This markdown document provides a visual overview of selected exercises from the Dodona learning path for criminology students. Each section includes the screenshot, its content description, and relevant pedagogical context (Bloom’s Taxonomy level, feedback logic, scaffolding, etc.).

## 1. Series Overview – Part 1

![dodona-series-overview-1](dodona-series-overview-1.png)

**Description:** Shows the top portion of the full exercise series within the 'Basisstatistiek' course on Dodona.

**Purpose:** Highlights the structure and entry point of the course, where students see the learning objectives and can track their progress.

## 2. Series Overview – Part 2

![dodona-series-overview-2](dodona-series-overview-2.png)

**Description:** Displays the middle section of the course, including the first part: *Basisbegrippen en Toepassingen*.

**Purpose:** Demonstrates the progressive introduction of fundamental statistical concepts (e.g., measurement levels, crime rate, correlation). Most exercises here are aligned with Bloom’s levels: Remember, Understand, and Apply.

## 3. Series Overview – Part 3

![dodona-series-overview-3](dodona-series-overview-3.png)

**Description:** Covers the final section *Analyse en Evaluatie in Statistiek*, including advanced interpretation tasks (e.g., boxplots, leverage, spurious correlation).

**Purpose:** This section supports higher-order thinking with questions that target Bloom’s levels: Analyze and Evaluate. It encourages students to interpret patterns, detect outliers, and assess methodological choices using realistic data.

## 2. Score Summary (Total Overview)

![2. Score Summary (Total Overview)](../images/dodona_scoresheet_total_overview.png)

**Description:** This shows the overall completion status for each user across the three sections.

**Purpose:** Allows monitoring of student progress and identifies where further scaffolding or support may be needed.

## 3. Score Summary – Basic Concepts

![3. Score Summary – Basic Concepts](../images/dodona_scoresheet_basisbegrippen_toepassingen.png)

**Description:** This view provides insight into user performance on foundational concepts like measurement levels and descriptive statistics.

**Purpose:** Helps identify specific strengths and weaknesses in early-stage comprehension.

## 4. Score Summary – Analysis and Evaluation

![4. Score Summary – Analysis and Evaluation](../images/dodona_scoresheet_analyse_evaluatie_statistiek.png)

**Description:** This section reflects progress on more complex tasks such as regression, outliers, and statistical inference.

**Purpose:** Highlights students’ abilities to apply and evaluate statistical models using criminological data.

## 5. Crime Rate Calculation Exercise

![5. Crime Rate Calculation Exercise](../images/crime-rate-calculation.png)

**Description:** A simple question asking students to calculate crime rate per 1,000 inhabitants.

**Purpose:** Trains students in basic rate calculation using real-world population and crime data.

## 6. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

![6. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics](../images/descriptive-vs-inferential.png)

**Description:** This question checks understanding of the distinction between summarizing data and making predictions.

**Purpose:** Reinforces conceptual clarity on the purpose of statistical approaches.

## 7. Hypothesis Testing Exercise

![7. Hypothesis Testing Exercise](../images/hypothesis-video-question.png)

**Description:** A multimedia-supported question prompting students to define the correct null hypothesis.

**Purpose:** Introduces inferential statistics with visual support, helping explain abstract ideas.

## 8. Histogram Interpretation

![8. Histogram Interpretation](../images/histogram-interpretation.png)

**Description:** Asks students to interpret the shape and distribution from a histogram of participant ages.

**Purpose:** Promotes data literacy and visual interpretation skills.

## 9. Outlier Identification (Correct Answer)

![9. Outlier Identification (Correct Answer)](../images/outlier-feedback-correct.png)

**Description:** Demonstrates how feedback is presented when students correctly identify a statistical outlier.

**Purpose:** Confirms correct reasoning with step-by-step solution and statistical justification (Z-score logic).

## 10. Outlier Identification (Incorrect Answer)

![10. Outlier Identification (Incorrect Answer)](../images/outlier-feedback-wrong.png)

**Description:** Illustrates how detailed feedback is used to correct misunderstandings.

**Purpose:** Leverages feedback as a learning opportunity by explaining why an answer is incorrect.
