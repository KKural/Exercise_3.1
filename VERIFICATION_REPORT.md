## Issues Found and Recommendations

### 1. Missing Calculation Exercises
The course needs more hands-on calculation exercises for:
- **Standard Deviation & Variance**: No dedicated exercise
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Students should calculate r manually
- **t-test Calculations**: Manual t-statistic calculation
- **Confidence Intervals**: Construction and interpretation
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d calculation
- **Regression**: Simple linear regression calculations

### 2. Language Consistency Issues
- Exercise 5 mixes English and Dutch in description
- Some feedback messages need standardization

### 3. Exercise Progression
- Good progression from basic concepts to advanced topics
- Could benefit from more scaffolded calculation exercises

## Recommended New Calculation Exercises

### Exercise A: Standard Deviation & Variance Calculation
**Topic**: Calculating measures of dispersion
**Data**: Crime rates: [12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 28, 32, 35]
**Task**: Calculate standard deviation manually (step-by-step)

### Exercise B: Correlation Coefficient Calculation
**Topic**: Manual calculation of Pearson's r
**Data**: Police patrols vs. crime incidents (paired data)
**Task**: Calculate correlation coefficient using formula

### Exercise C: t-test Calculation
**Topic**: Independent samples t-test
**Data**: Crime rates before/after intervention
**Task**: Calculate t-statistic manually

### Exercise D: Confidence Interval Construction
**Topic**: 95% CI for mean crime rate
**Data**: Sample of district crime rates
**Task**: Calculate and interpret confidence interval

### Exercise E: Effect Size (Cohen's d)
**Topic**: Practical significance
**Data**: Crime reduction intervention results
**Task**: Calculate Cohen's d for effect size

### Exercise F: Simple Linear Regression
**Topic**: Manual regression calculations
**Data**: Unemployment rate vs. theft incidents
**Task**: Calculate slope, intercept, and R²

## Technical Issues Found

### Exercise Validation Scripts
- All R validation scripts are properly structured
- Good error handling and feedback messages
- Appropriate tolerance levels for numerical answers

### Exercise Descriptions
- Clear instructions in most exercises
- Mathematical formulas properly formatted
- Good use of hints and context

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority ✅
1. Fix language mixing in Exercise 5
2. Add standard deviation calculation exercise
3. Add correlation coefficient calculation exercise

### Medium Priority 📋
4. Add t-test calculation exercise
5. Add confidence interval exercise
6. Enhance existing exercises with more detailed feedback

### Low Priority 📝
7. Add effect size calculation exercise
8. Add regression calculation exercise
9. Create summary/review exercises

## Overall Assessment: GOOD ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured progression from basic to advanced concepts
- Good mix of conceptual and computational exercises
- Comprehensive coverage of key statistical concepts
- Excellent use of criminology context throughout
- Proper R validation with detailed feedback

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Need more manual calculation exercises for core statistics
- Language consistency in some exercises
- Could benefit from more scaffolded learning in calculations

**Recommendation:** Add 3-4 new calculation exercises focusing on standard deviation, correlation, t-tests, and confidence intervals to create a more complete computational learning experience.
